                  GracePeriod indicates the duration the VWA should wait after applying updates before
                  making further adjustments. This allows for stabilization of the resource usage after changes.

                  This can help Kubernetes make scheduling decisions based on the resource guarantees.
                  Possible values are:
                  - "Guaranteed": CPU and Memory requests are equal to limits for all containers.
                  - "Burstable": Requests are lower than limits, allowing bursts of usage.

                  StepSize represents the incremental size by which the resource requests (CPU and Memory)
                  can be adjusted during each update. This allows for controlled and gradual scaling.
                  For example, a step size of "200m" for CPU means that requests can be increased or decreased
                  by 200 milliCPU units.
