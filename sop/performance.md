# VerticalWorkloadAutoscaler Performance Testing

This document outlines the steps required to prepare and execute performance tests for the VerticalWorkloadAutoscaler controller.

## 1. Environment Setup

- [ ] Set up a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., using kind, minikube, or a cloud provider)
- [ ] Deploy the VerticalWorkloadAutoscaler controller to the cluster
- [ ] Ensure the cluster has sufficient resources to handle the load (CPU, memory, etc.)

## 2. Tools

- [ ] Use a load testing tool (e.g., k6, locust) to simulate workload
- [ ] Use monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to collect performance metrics

## 3. Test Scenarios

- [ ] Simulate a large number of VerticalWorkloadAutoscaler objects
- [ ] Simulate frequent VPA recommendation updates
- [ ] Simulate various configurations (different StepSize, update frequencies, etc.)
- [ ] Measure the controller's response time and resource usage

## 4. Execution

- [ ] Run the load tests using the chosen tool
- [ ] Monitor the cluster's performance using the monitoring tools
- [ ] Collect and analyze the performance data

## 5. Reporting

- [ ] Generate a performance report with key metrics (response time, resource usage, etc.)
- [ ] Identify any performance bottlenecks or issues
- [ ] Provide recommendations for optimization

## 6. Review and Refine

- [ ] Review the performance test results
- [ ] Refine the implementation based on the findings
- [ ] Repeat the performance tests to validate improvements
